# star-tracker
<h1>Open Source Star Tracker for OreSat with Python and OpenCV</h1>

<h2>To-Do:</h2>
	- make '__init__.py'?

<h2>Future Additions:</h2>
	- Figure out approx number of bright stars to expect in a given frame(from catalogue). Then, have OpenCV modify the thresh value until the # of found stars is approx what we should expect.
